## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Typescript, Next.js, Styled-Components, Cypress (intergration tests)
**APIs used:** Airtable, Instagram(Meta)

## Optimizations

Could of use the Next.js Image Component instead of the standard html img tag for some images such as the instagram gallery photos being displayed. The Next.js Image component can help with minification of the file size thus improving the performance of the image depending on device the user is using and the data speed of their provider. Intergrate Glovo and Just Eat API to make ordering within the site.
